# im-pong-sible
> a simple ascii pong game
i remembered played a simple game called pong, and i wonder what if i could recreate such a legend but with a twist, its 3d!



on this main branch i have created a simple PoC  using simple front‑end stack. i tried to make the game looked like the original but i also inspired in ascii, so.. there you go, imo the 3d is okay... maybe we could do some adjustment

in future im not gonna change the bot mechanism, its called im-pong-siblee for a reason, but maybe i toned it down a bit.


i havent decided if we should use framework or any game engine yet. but i tried to create it in C just for the sake of running it in terminal. but i maybe not gonna fully focused on this, because it is a side project that probably died soon.
